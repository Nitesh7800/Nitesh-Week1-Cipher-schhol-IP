    <h3>MY Blog Post 1</h3>
    <p>Hailing from the city of Jalandhar, I am Madhav from Punjab. Presently I am in college and preparing for my mid term examination. I study in Apeejay school, one of the prestigious institutions in India. This institution has always kept me motivated and encouraged me towards working for the betterment of society as well as the development of my inner self.
        My father is an engineer and my mother is a doctor. Loving their profession is one of the greatest inspirations they provide me each day. I am the only child of my parents. They keep me motivated and always make me learn from my failures. Your family is one of the backbone and support which helps you stand in todayâ€™s cutthroat competition.

    <p>My school has an important role in my holistic development. Whatever I am today, is just because of my family and friends and my school. My teachers have always taught me to be energetic and full of positivity. They inspire me each day to be better.
        I am a bookworm and I enjoy reading various types of novels as well as classic literature like Shakespearean dramas. I also love to go through Indian history as I have a deep interest in knowing about it. Apart from reading, I am very fond of writing poems of my choice. 
        Recently, I am also focussing on Learning guitar
